Feature: API Testing for Undefined User Story Scenarios

Background:
  Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
  And the authorization header is set to 'Bearer <token>'
  And the content type is 'application/json'

Scenario: Handle Undefined User Story Scenario Gracefully
  Given the system lacks user story details
  When I send a GET request to '/undefined-feature'
  Then the response status should be 404
  And the response body should contain 'Feature not found'
  And the system should not display any error

Scenario: System Stability with Undefined Input
  Given the system is running and accessible
  When I send a POST request to '/undefined-feature' with an empty payload
  Then the response status should be 400
  And the response body should contain 'Invalid input'
  And the system should remain stable and responsive

Scenario: Test System Behavior with Undefined User Story
  Given I attempt to access a system feature related to an undefined user story
  When I send a DELETE request to '/undefined-feature/123'
  Then the response status should be 404
  And the response body should contain 'Resource not found'
  And no system errors should occur

Scenario: System Performance with Missing User Story Inputs
  Given the system is operational
  When I send a PUT request to '/undefined-feature/123' with a valid payload
  Then the response status should be 404
  And the response body should contain 'Feature not available'
  And the system should not crash or behave unexpectedly

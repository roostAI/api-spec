          Scenario: This scenario focuses on testing various non-successful requests for the /employees/{id} endpoint, targeting failure cases, edge cases, and error handling.
      - log:
          Flow: The flow includes multiple GET requests designed to trigger HTTP response codes outside the 200-299 success range.

      - log:
          Request: Attempting to retrieve an employee with an 'id' that is not a valid UUID format.
      - log:
          Expected Outcome: HTTP 400 Bad Request, indicating a client-side error due to malformed input.
      - get:
          url: "/employees/{{ id }}"

      - log:
          Request: Attempting to retrieve an employee with an 'id' that is a valid UUID format but does not exist in the system.
      - log:
          Expected Outcome: HTTP 404 Not Found, indicating the specified resource could not be found.
      - get:
          url: "/employees/{{ id }}"

      - think: 1

      - log:
          Request: Attempting to access the '/employees' endpoint without providing the required '{id}' path parameter.
      - log:
          Expected Outcome: HTTP 404 Not Found, as the server expects a specific path structure for resource identification.
      - get:
          url: "/employees"
          expect:
            - statusCode: 404

      - think: 1

      - log:
          Request: Attempting to access a non-existent or misspelled URL path (e.g., '/employes' instead of '/employees').
      - log:
          Expected Outcome: HTTP 404 Not Found, as the requested URL path does not map to any available resource.
      - get:
          url: "/employes/a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11"

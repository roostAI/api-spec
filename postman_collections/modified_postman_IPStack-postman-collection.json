Simply click the button below to fork it.\n\n[<img src=\"https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg\">](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/10131015-55145132-244c-448c-8e6f-8780866e4862?action=collection/fork)\n\n### Step 2: Get your API Access Key\n\n1. Go to the [IP Stack](https://ipstack.com/?utm_source=Postman&utm_medium=Referral) website and choose the right subscription plan for your particular project.\n2. Get your personal API Access Key on the [Dashboard](https://ipstack.com/dashboard) to authenticate with the API. Keep it safe! You can reset it at any time in your Account Dashboard.\n    \n\n## Step 3: Make your first API call\n\nIP Stack Postman collection contains all the three endpoint supported by IP Stack API.\n\n1. Standard IP Lookup\n2. Bulk IP Lookup\n3. Requester Lookup\n    \n\nWe recommend you to start with the Standard IP Lookup endpoint as it's primary endpoint. It is used to look up single IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. To call this endpoint, simply attach any IPv4 or IPv6 address to the API's base URL.\n\nCheck out all the widely used API calls with the necessary parameters in the [Standard IP Lookup folder](https://apilayer.postman.co/workspace/APILayer~2b7498b6-6d91-4fa8-817f-608441fe42a8/folder/10131015-594322f8-abae-4135-80d1-2cf544caa60b?action=share&creator=10131015&ctx=documentation).",
